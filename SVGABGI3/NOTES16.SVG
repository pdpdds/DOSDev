SuperVGA 16 BGI driver
Version 1.11
August 20, 1991

This is the latest version of my 16 color BGI driver.  All functions have
been implemented (including paging and floodfill), and should work like
the EGAVGA driver.

	o Fixed getimage bug

	o Added new logical operations to putimage:
	  XNOR_PUT
	  NAND_PUT
	  NOR_PUT
