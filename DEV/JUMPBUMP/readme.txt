                 Code by Mattias Brynervall
               Graphics by Andreas Brynervall

                         INSTRUCTIONS

Leap over the log, and bound off to the right to play.
The different rabbits are controlled with:

                     DOTT    LEFT/RIGHT/UP
                     JIFFY   A/D/W
                     FIZZ    Mouse Buttons
                     MIJJI   Joystick

There are two ways to steer FIZZ, depending on if you have
two or three mouse buttons. With two buttons you jump by
pressing both buttons. With three buttons you jump with
the middle button.

In the arena there's only one thing to do.
Jump around like crazy and try to get on top of the others!


                           MODIFY

This is actually the second release of Jump 'n Bump. In the
first release, you were limited to just one level. But we
got a lot of letters asking for more levels and/or a level
editor. How could we possibly say no to that?

In this release, we have submitted programs to pack/unpack
'jumpbump.dat', thus giving you the possibility to change
whatever you might want to change. This also means that you
can do your very own Jump 'n Bump levels!

To play a user-made level, you just write:

                jumpbump.exe -dat filename.dat

This will run the level filename.dat. Of course you'll have
to supply the name of the dat-file containing the level. Duh!

To get more instructions on how you do to make your own
levels or change the graphics/music in the game, please
read 'modify.txt'.

                       OTHER PARAMETERS

There are some other parameters that Jump 'n Bump recognize:

                     jumpbump.exe -nogore

This will remove all the blood and gore from the game.
It also makes the game a lot less fun, but can be used to
make the game more child friendly.

                     jumpbump.exe -nosound

This will make the game run without sound. Don't know what
the point with this is, but hey, why not?

                     jumpbump.exe -nojoy

This will disable joystick support. Can be very useful if
Jump 'n Bump is having trouble reading your joystick and
MIJJI (the joystick rabbit) freaks out.

                     jumpbump.exe -mouse 2
                              or
                     jumpbump.exe -mouse 3

This will force Jump 'n Bump to detect a 2/3 button mouse.

There's also a secret parameter. Try and find it!
