   Pierre Jelenc, pcj1@columbia.edu, will maintain and
   distribute documentation and support files for translated versions of
   TDE.  Some users are interested in using TDE with non-English
   languages.  Check with Pierre before you translate the documentation,
   as he may have the language version you need.  Incidentally, Pierre
   is also developing a language independent sort program.

   For those in the Department of Defence, Tom Waters,
   twaters@relay.nswc.navy.mil, will be available to answer questions
   and provide support.  He has worked with TDE source code since
   version 1.0, so he knows how the guts of the program works.  Usually,
   the hardware and software at DoD are from the same manufacturor, so
   he may have a version of TDE that takes advantage of the capabilities
   of those machines.

Legal Legal Stuff:

  Six years ago, as an employee of the Federal government, as part of
my official duties, I wrote several editors that use a double linked
list.  The new scheme in TDE 2.2 uses a double linked list.  Some of the
concepts and/or code and/or techniques that I used to develop those
editors as part of my official duties are incorporated into TDE 2.2.
Being that my current official duties as an employee of the Federal
government requires that I maintain and support those editors, as a
matter of law and ethics, version 3.0 of TDE is released into the public
domain.  It's not so much that I want to release TDE into the public
domain, but more so, it's the law that requires that I release TDE into
the public domain.  Not only is TDE 3.0 based on DTE 5.1, the public
domain editor by Doug Thomson, but it is also based on works of the
United States government, written and currently maintained by my
ownself, Frank.  Many of the ideas that are incorporated into TDE were
derived from editing tasks needed on the job.  Copyrighting off-the-job
what I do on-the-job would not be ethical.

SIMTEL20 allows only nine ANONYMOUS FTP logins during weekday prime
time, 5am to 3pm Mountain Time (GMT-7), but 27 otherwise.

SIMTEL20 files are also available by anonymous ftp from mirror sites
OAK.Oakland.Edu (141.210.10.117), wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4),

1-900-GOT-SRCS.  See UUNET file uunet!~/info/archive-help for details.

OAK.Oakland.Edu is the primary mirror site for WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil.
All other mirror sites (except wuarchive) and all LISTSERV and TRICKLE
servers get their SIMTEL20 files from OAK instead of SIMTEL20 because
it is much faster and allows more simultaneous ftp connections.  OAK is
always "in sync" with SIMTEL20 because I maintain it, in addition to my
duties at SIMTEL20.  I run OAK's mirror program whenever new files are
added at SIMTEL20.

If you cannot access them via FTP or e-mail, most SIMTEL20 MSDOS
files, including the PC-Blue collection, are also available for
downloading from Detroit Download Central (313) 885-3956.  DDC
has multiple lines which support 300/1200/2400/9600/14400 bps
(103/212/V22bis/HST/V32bis/V42bis/MNP).  This is a subscription system
with an average hourly cost of 17 cents.  It is also accessable on
Telenet via PC Pursuit and on Tymnet via StarLink outdial.  New files
uploaded to SIMTEL20 are usually available on DDC within 24 hours.

CD-ROM copies of the SIMTEL20 MS-DOS collection are available from

            WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil switches to ZIP 2.0

Effective April 2, 1993 many of the new ZIP files uploaded to SIMTEL20
will be in the public domain ZIP version 2.0 format.  After that date
the index files SIMIBM.ZIP and SIMLIST.ZIP will be created in the new
format.

SIMTEL20 has standardized on the Info-ZIP group's ZIP and UNZIP because
they are freely distributable and they have no restrictions on exporting.
The latest version of Info-ZIP's ZIP and UNZIP can always be found in
directory PD1:<MSDOS.ZIP> and will always have the name "Info-ZIP" in
the description to make them easy to locate.

PKWare's PKZIP 2.x will not be offered due to export restrictions.
Older versions of PKZIP will be deleted to avoid confusion due to
the fact that they cannot handle the ZIP version 2.0 format files.

                         Keystone Connection BBS

  The Keystone Connection BBS (904)473-9790 is a free public board.  This
is a multiline BBS with no restrictions.  The latest version of TDE will
always be available here.  USRobotics Dual Standard modems allow
connections up through 16800 bps, so it will only take a few minutes to
download the file.  TDE will be in directory 15, the DOS help/utils
directory.  If you have any questions concerning the BBS, leave a message
for the friendly sysop, Bruce McHollan.  If you have any questions
concerning TDE, leave a message for me, Frank.  I usually drop by Keystone C.
once or twice a week.


Background:

  At work, I have written several editors that may only be used for a
certain type of file (almost an expert system).  I have always wanted to
write a general purpose public domain text editor.  It seems none of the
existing public domain or shareware editors have all of the features I
like.  I'm stupid and proud of it.  Since I'm so stupid, the new editor
should be really easy to use.  My wish list of features are:

   Blocks:
      Line, stream, and box blocks.
      Move, delete, copy, kopy, overlay, fill, print, number, and sort.
      Block actions within or between files.

   Files:
      Multiple files limited only by memory.
      Text and binary files.

   Windows:
      Multiple windows limited only by memory.
      Split screen horizontally and vertically
      Changes to text in one window are updated in all windows of same file.
      Interactively resize windows.
      Two windows of same size so two files can be easily compared.

   Search/Replace:
      Ignore or Match case of pattern.
      Prompt or no prompt replace.
      Boyer-Moore pattern matching algorithm.

   User Configuration:
      Ability to assign any editor function to any recognized function key.
      Redefine color attributes in all editor fields.
      Change default editor settings.
      Macro recording and playback.

   Other:
      Split/join line.
      Lines as long a 1040 characters.
      Paren balance.
      Mode/information line.
      Cursor sync.
      Directory list
      Ruler with a cursor pointer



Douglas Thomson's editor, DTE 5.1:

  Well, I found a public domain editor that had most of the features on my
wish list.  The original code was extremely well documented.  That editor
was DTE 5.1, written by Douglas Thomson, Gippsland, Victoria, Australia.
So instead of writing an editor from scratch, I based my editor around
Doug's well designed and documented program.   My editor was written using
DTE 5.1 as an outline.  Doug, thanks a lot for releasing the source code
for your editor.

  DTE 5.1 is pretty much machine independent.  It runs on PC's, HP 3000's,
and generic Unix system V release 2 systems.  It was designed to work well
over slow communication lines, eg 1200 baud.  Screen updates are kept to a
minimum which saves time and money when using dial-up phone lines.  DTE
5.1 uses the WordStar/Turbo x style key definitions.  If you need an
editor for use over slow communication terminals, check out Doug's editor.


TDE, the Thomson-Davis Editor:

  My dream editor was to be written specifically for PC's.  At work, we
have an IBM mainframe.  The only reason I use the mainframe is for e-mail
and for backup of my PC files (I have exaggerated a little).  I use my PC
editors to compose my mail then upload to the mainframe to send it.  So, I
really don't need or desire a machine independent editor.

  Being that the big text buffer was replaced by a double linked list,
most of the pointer arithmetic stuff went away.  Now that TDE can handle
binary files, the '\0' and ^Z went away, too.

  I modified almost all of the algorithms in the original DTE 5.1 editor
and added several more.  The block and find/replace algorithms are
completely rewritten.  Block operations now use line, box, and stream
blocks.  Available block operations include move, delete, copy, kopy,
fill, overlay, block expand tabs, block compress tabs, block compress
indent tab, block print, block write to file, block upper case, block
lower case, block strip hi bit, trim block, number box block, swap block,
and sort box block (a few of these functions were available for stream
blocks in the original DTE 5.1).  Block operations are allowed within or
between files.  The "brute force" text find algorithm was replaced by the
Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm, a very fast text search algorithm.
The text display algorithms were rewritten.  Window operations were
rewritten, enhanced, and streamlined.  Windows may now be split vertically
as well as horizontally.  Support for lines as long as 1040 characters was
added.  Horizontal scrolling/paging/panning are allowed.  A mode/
information lite bar was added to display the various modes at the bottom
of the screen.  Displayed in the lite bar are: number of open files and
total number of windows, available memory for editing the current file or
additional files, and the editor mode flags.  Displayed with the file name
are:  file attributes, the total number of lines in the file (size), and
the current line number and column number of the cursor.  The join line,
split line, and dup line functions were added.  Any ASCII or Extended
ASCII character can be entered into the text file by using the ALT-xxx
method.  Several often used string routines were rewritten in assembly
and optimized for 16 bit processors, which makes cursor movement very
fast through any size file.  One function that I sorely missed, a simple
undelete function, was added.  A few simple word processing functions
were also added: word wrap, paragraph format, and left, right, and
center justify functions.  A dynamic left margin was added for writers.
Smart tabs were added for use with tables and formatted data files.  To
make TDE a more "standard" editor, logical physical tabs were added.
With TabInflate, the user no longer has to physically expand tabs, as
TDE will inflate tabs on the screen.  Also added was a cursor sync
function.  After using the sync function for a day, it became apparent
that a hilited cursor line was needed to keep track of cursor positions
in all windows.  A directory function was added so users may search
directories for files to load.  The file loading feature was expanded to
make TDE search a file list for a pattern.  Files are loaded only if the
pattern is present.  Another useful feature, a key stroke record and
playback (simple macros), was added to make simple, repititive, editing
tasks easier; recursive macros are allowed.  A critical error handler
was added to give the user more info on hardware faults.  To help users
construct formatted data or formatted source code (FORTRAN) files, a
ruler line with a column pointer was added.  Now, TDE will diff any two
windows.  A configuration utility was written to allow the user to
customize all colors and the 233 recognized function keys with no
restrictions.  Users may now customize the sort sequence for
Ignore/Match case, which allows for correct sorting of alphabets with
characters in the Extended ASCII character set.  All keys, modes, and
colors may be assigned from a configuration file.  For users who work
with alphabets that contain special accent characters, any ASCII or
Extended ASCII character may be assigned to unused function keys by
permanently storing a macro definition file in tde.exe.  And last, an
instant help screen with key definitions was added.


Programming Notes:

  The text buffer scheme was replaced by a double linked list.  During
testing, I also implemented an array of text pointers.  Just thought
a double linked list was easier.  Incidentally, in previous versions
of the READ_ME.TDE file, I wrote that most commercial editors use a
relocatable array of text pointers.  That's probably wrong  -- most
commercial editors use a double linked list.  Even the editors that
I wrote at work over the past six years use a double linked list.
Oh well, just reinforcing how stupid I am.  I have trouble remembering
what I did five minutes ago.

  The 101 key keyboard simulation utility requires an assembler to produce
object code.  If you don't have access to an assembler, you may comment
out the calls to function simulate_enh_kbd( ) in main.c.  TDE will still
take advantage of the 101 enhanced keyboard, but will not be able to use
the simulated 101 keys on older 83/84 keyboard systems.

  Several functions in TDE return an integer value that indicates whether
or not an ERROR occured.  The variable name most often used to return the
result is "rc".  For non-IBM mainframers, rc == return code.


Further Reference/Reading:

  "The Literature" is filled with all areas of text editing:  human
factors, construction schemes, function definitions, pattern matching,
documentation guidelines, and a proposed ANSI/ISO standard for editors.
Some journals you might browse thru are Communications of the ACM,
Journal of the ACM, Computing Surveys, Software-Practice and Experience,
and SIAM Journal on Computing.

  One particular publication you might browse is _ACM Sigplan Notices_
16 (No. 6), June 1981, Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN SIGOA Symposium on
Text Manipulation, Portland, Oregon, June 8-10, 1981 (ACM Order No.
548810).  Several papers on text editing/manipulation were presented.
One paper you might read is by Richard M. Stallman, "EMACS The
Extensible, Customizable Self-Documenting Display Editor", pp 147-156.
EMACS and EMACS subsets have been ported numerous times to most major
operating systems.

  A text that encourages good programming practices while including
"real world" examples is by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger,
_Software Tools_, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Mass.,
1976, ISBN 0-201-03669-X.  Incidentally, the authors present all the
tools needed to construct a text editor.  You may recognize Brian
Kernighan as a coauthor of _The C Programming Language_, 1978 and 1988,
Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, ISBN 0-13-110362-8.  And,
you may recognize P. J. Plauger as the secretary of X3J11, the ANSI
technical subcommittee on C language standardization.

About the author of TDE, Frank Davis:

  Frank "yank" Davis, who has an impressive collection of inflatable bed
bunnies, graduated near the bottom of his class in 1983 from Georgia Tech
with a BS in Information and Computer Science.  He can be found drinking
massive quantities of beer in his underwear (boxer shorts) on his couch
while watching college football and Atlanta Braves baseball on his 19 inch
color TV.  Hobbies include:  sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.

  This program is another quality product from Yank Software, "Software
you just can't beat."
