/*
 * These functions sort lines according to keys in a marked BOX block.
 *
 * Being that the data structure was changed from a big text buffer to a
 * linked list, we can replace the simple insertion sort algorithm with a
 * much faster sort algorithm.  The classic search and sort reference is by
 * Donald E. Knuth, _The Art of Computer Programming; Volume 3:  Sorting and
 * Searching_.  One of the fastest and most widely used general purpose
 * sorting algorithms is the "Quicksort" algorithm.
 *
 * For implementation hints and guidelines on the Quicksort algorithm, one
 * might read the original Quicksort paper by C. A. R. Hoare or anything
 * by Robert Sedgewick.  Although Dr. Sedgewick includes a chapter on
 * Quicksort in his intro computer science textbooks, _Algorithms in X_,
 * I prefer the detailed hints and guidelines in his 1978 CACM paper.
 * Incidentally, Dr. Sedgewick's Ph.D. dissertation was on the modification
 * and mathematical analysis of the Quicksort algorithm.

 *                           Quicksort in TDE
 *
 * Quicksort in TDE is a stable, non-recursive implementation based on
 * Program 2, page 851, CACM, 21 (No. 10), 1978, by Robert Sedgewick.  My
 * partition algorithm finds the median-of-three.  Then, it walks from the
 * head of the list, comparing nodes, and uses the first occurrence of the
 * key of the median-of-three as the partition node.  Mostly by accident
 * and partly by design, my partition routine uses a "fat pivot" to keep
 * equal nodes in the same relative order as they appear in the file (the
 * definition of a stable sort).  By using the first median-of-three node
 * as the partitioning node, 1) sorting a sorted list is fairly fast and
 * 2) encountering a worst case is very unlikely.  TDE will sort, fairly
 * fast, multiple keys ascending or descending, ignore or match case, and
 * preserve order in the file, while using a custom sort sequence for your
 * favorite domestic or foreign language.
